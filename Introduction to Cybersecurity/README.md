## 🌐 **1.1 – The World of Cybersecurity**

# **What Is Cybersecurity?**
Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect **individuals, organizations, and governments** from digital attacks by securing networked systems and data from unauthorized access, misuse, or damage.

Cybersecurity works at **three major levels of protection**:

---

# **1. Personal Level**
At a personal level, cybersecurity focuses on protecting your **identity, personal data, and computing devices**. Every individual must take responsibility for safeguarding their information from theft, misuse, or unauthorized access.

---

# **2. Organizational Level**
At an organizational level, cybersecurity is a **shared responsibility**. Every employee plays a role in protecting:

- Organizational data  
- Customer information  
- Company reputation  

A failure in security can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and loss of trust.

---

# **3. Government Level**
At the government level, cybersecurity becomes even more critical because massive amounts of digital information are collected and shared. Protection is essential to ensure:

- National security  
- Economic stability  
- Safety and wellbeing of citizens  

---

# **Protecting Your Personal Data**

**Personal data** refers to any information that can be used to identify you. It exists both **offline and online**.

---

## **Offline Identity**
Your offline identity represents your real-world presence at home, school, or work. It includes:

- Full name  
- Age  
- Address  
- Personal life details  

Even offline information must be protected, as identity thieves can steal data when you are not paying attention.

---

## **Online Identity**
Your online identity is how you present yourself on the internet. It includes:

- Usernames or aliases  
- Online profiles  
- Social interactions  
- Digital behavior  

You should limit how much personal information you share online to reduce security risks.

---

# **Your Data**
Personal data includes information such as:

- Name  
- Social Security number  
- Driver’s license number  
- Date and place of birth  
- Mother’s maiden name  
- Photos and private messages  

Cybercriminals can use this sensitive data to impersonate you, violate your privacy, and damage your reputation.

---

# **Medical Records**
Medical records contain sensitive information related to your physical and mental health. These are stored in **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**.

They may include:
- Medical history  
- Diagnoses  
- Prescriptions  
- Test results  

Modern fitness devices also collect:
- Heart rate  
- Blood pressure  
- Blood sugar levels  

Since much of this data is stored in the cloud, it must be treated as highly confidential.

---

# **Education Records**
Education records contain information related to your academic life, including:

- Academic qualifications  
- Attendance records  
- Disciplinary reports  
- Contact details  
- Health and immunization records  
- Special education records (IEPs)  

Such records can expose sensitive details if not properly protected.

---

# **Employment and Financial Records**
Employment and financial data are highly valuable targets for cybercriminals.

### **Employment Records**
- Job history  
- Performance reviews  
- Employer details  

### **Financial Records**
- Income and expenditure  
- Tax records  
- Credit card statements  
- Credit score  
- Bank account details  

If compromised, this information can lead to fraud, identity theft, and financial loss.

---

# **Who Else Wants My Data?**
It’s not only cybercriminals who are interested in your personal information.

---

## **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**
ISPs track your online activity and, in some countries, may sell this data to advertisers.  
They may also be legally required to share user information with government authorities.

---

## **Advertisers**
Advertisers monitor:
- Browsing behavior  
- Shopping habits  
- Personal preferences  

This data helps them deliver targeted advertisements.

---

## **Search Engines and Social Media Platforms**
These platforms collect data such as:
- Gender  
- Location  
- Phone number  
- Political and religious interests  
- Search history  

This information is often sold to advertisers for profit.

---

## **Websites You Visit**
Websites use **cookies** to track user activity and personalize experiences.  
This creates a data trail linked to your online identity, which may eventually reach advertisers.
